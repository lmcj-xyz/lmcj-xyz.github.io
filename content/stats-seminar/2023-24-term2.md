### A short introduction to stochastic calculus
by *Yukun Cao*

Abstract: As we dive into the world of randomness, a precise way to integrate with respect to a stochastic process is needed. However, the usual way of Lebesgue integral is usually not enough. We will have to consider a new way of integration: Ito integral.  We will examine the construction of Brownian motion and Ito integral with respect to Brownian motion and if time permitting some properties of this new way of integration.
