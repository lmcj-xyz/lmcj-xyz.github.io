Currently I am a PhD student working under the supervision of
[Elena Issoglio](https://sites.google.com/view/elenaissoglio/home)
and
[Jan Palczewski](https://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~jp/)
on a project concerning theoretical analysis and implementation of numerical schemes stochastic differential equations with singular coefficients.

## Research interests {#Interests}
My research interests are a combination of stochastic analysis and numerical analysis with strong links to partial differential equations, in particular:

- **Theoretical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Stochastic Differencial Equations with singular coefficients:**
We aim to find results concerning the convergence rates of SDEs with coefficients living in spaces of generalised functions, in particular with drifs in Hölder-Zygmund spaces.
Also for one type of non-linear SDEs, namely involving the law of the solution known as McKean-Vlasov SDEs, we also study the case with distributional coefficients in Hölder-Zygmund spaces.
