So, some time ago I posted that [I wanted to add three languages in my website](https://lmcj.xyz/posts/2022-06-19-languages-in-this-website/). 
If you read that and found it completely unreasonable, as that statement is, you should have called me out on my bullshit.

Everything is in English now, the only bad thing is that I want to share the Galleries with my family and that should be in Spanish, I guess I can use the Hugo feature for multilanguage only for that. Anyway, that is not too important.

Also, probably tomorrow I will publish some pictures from my trip to Florence.
