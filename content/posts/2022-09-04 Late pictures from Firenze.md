So...I went to Firenze and Pisa.

I have to say it, Firenze is probably the most beautiful and impressing city I have ever seen in my entire life, but it is so incredibly crowded that I found it difficult to trully enjoy. Also, it is quite expensive.

On the other hand, Pisa is such a small and charming place. Many people told me it was an underwhelming city whose only attractive is literally the _piazza del Duomo_, where the leaning tower and the cathedral is. And yes those places are incredibly crowded, and I feel the pandemic had a huge impact by the looks of many streets, but there are just so many small and intimate squares in the neighbourhoods along the river. I loved this city, it is just quiet and small.

And here are the pictures...
