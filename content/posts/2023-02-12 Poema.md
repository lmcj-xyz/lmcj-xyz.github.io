# Daisies by Andrew Young

> The stars are everywhere tonight,

> above, beneath me and around;

> they fill the sky with powdery light

> and glimmer from the night-strewn ground;

> for where the folded daisies are

> in every one I see a star.

> And so I know that when I pass

> where no sun's shadow counts the hours

> and where the sky was there is grass

> and where the stars were there are flowers,

> through the long night in which I lie

> stars will be shining in my sky.
