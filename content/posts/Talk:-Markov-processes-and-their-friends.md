I have prepared a talk which I intend to be my "sure, I can give a talk" if anyone asks me at any point.

The name is "Markov processes and their friends" and you can find the first version of it at the end of the
[Academic](/academic)
profile.

Or here:
- [Notes](/academic/2024-05-20-Pure.pdf)
- [The backboard prep notes](/academic/2024-05-20-Blackboard.pdf)
Those notes are the version one of the talk, presented in the Pure PGR Seminar in Leeds.

Oh, also I wrote those notes in [Typst](https://typst.app/) instead of LaTeX, I am liking that thing.
I guess you can make an account there, but I only downloaded the compiler and with that you are good to go.
There are a number of plugins for Neovim which are nice enough considering how early stage this software is, so I am overall pretty happy. I wish I discovered earlier so to write my thesis on it instead.
