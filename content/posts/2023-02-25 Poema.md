# Tibbie Dunbar by Robert Burns

[The tune by the Dubliners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVMU83QjJPc)

> O wilt thou go wi' me, sweet Tibbie Dunbar;

> O wilt thou go wi' me, sweet Tibbie Dunbar;

> Wilt thou ride on a horse, or be drawn in a car,

> Or walk by my side, O sweet Tibbie Dunbar.

> I care na thy daddie, his land and his money,

> I care na thy kin, sae high and sae lordly:

> But say thou wilt hae me for better for waur,

> And come in thy coatie, sweet Tibbie Dunbar.
