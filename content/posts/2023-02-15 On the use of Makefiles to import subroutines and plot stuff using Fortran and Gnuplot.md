Well...as usual I have delayed a project because I added unnecessary complexity to it, the project on hand is the solution to all the PC-Exercises on the monograph by Kloeden & Platen "Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations".
You can find this on
[Github](https://github.com/lmcj-xyz/PC_Exercises_from_Numerical_Solutions_of_SDEs_Kloeden_Platen).

Why?
Because I think is beneficial to have some reference in case you are stuck when you are reading some book.

What is the problem?
The problem is that I am not very well versed in the _Fortran_ programming language and I decided to do it using it _tO lEArN_.
