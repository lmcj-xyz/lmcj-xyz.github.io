<p>I first found this problem during my first few days as a PhD student on the book by Karatzas and Shreve [1], a staple for people working with continuous time stochastic processes. This is the very first problem in said book.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 1.1.5:</strong> Let $Y$ be a <em>modification</em> of $X$, and suppose that both processes have a.s. <em>right-continuous</em> paths. Then $X$ and $Y$ are <em>indistinguishable</em>.</p>
<p>And as stupid as I was at the time (not that much has changed ever since) the definition of <em>modification</em> and <em>indistinguishability</em> were, funnily enough, indistinguishable to me. Let us check those definitions, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Definition (modifications):</strong> $Y$ is a modification of $X$ if, for every point $t$, a.s. the equality $X_t = Y_t$ holds. I.e.</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{P}[X_t = Y_t] = 1$$</p>
<p><strong>Definition (indistinguishability):</strong> $X$ and $Y$ are indistinguishable if almost all their <em>sample paths</em> agree. I.e.</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{P}[X_t = Y_t; \forall t \geq 0] = 1$$.</p>
<p>Probably you can already see what I could not at first sight, but if not allow me to elaborate.
In my mind you the only difference here was where the cuantification $\forall t \geq 0$ was placed what is the difference if we have it inside or outside the application of the probability measure, well it turns out it makes all the difference.</p>
<p>To understand this, it&rsquo;s easier to think in terms of <em>events on a sample space</em>: modifications talk about the event ${X_t = Y_t}$ for all individual points $t \geq 0$, whereas indistinguishability deals with the event ${X_t = Y_t; \forall t \geq 0}$. Does this make it different for you now? No? Well, let us paint a picture.</p>
<p>ADD A PICTURE</p>
<p>The picture above is very revealing. Remember that a stochastic process can be though as a function $Z: \Omega \times (0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\Omega$ is the sample space and it&rsquo;s what gives the randomness to the stochastic process. For a fixed $\omega$, the map $Z_\cdot(\omega)$ is a function of time which we call sample path (sample path associated to $\omega$ you could say). On the figure above you see one sample path of $X$ in purple and one sample path of $Y$ in green, and also you see the points $X_t$ and $Y_t$ marked with an $\times$ and a $\circ$ respectively. So, what modifications take into account is that you can go over each point $t$ and find out that the event $X_t = Y_t$ happens for each sample path. Whereas indistinguishability takes the entire sample from $X$ and $Y$ paths and tell you that all of them are the same across time.</p>
<p>Now that this is clearer, let us recall the definition of right-continuity and finish this problem:</p>
<p><strong>Definition (right-continuity)$^{[2]}$:</strong> A function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is right-continuous if for every $t \in \mathbb{R}$ the limit</p>
<p>$$\lim_{s \to t^{+}} f(s)$$</p>
<p>exists and it&rsquo;s equal to $f(t)$.</p>
<p>We can see this on a picture:</p>
<p>ADD A PICTURE</p>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s solve the problem.</p>
<p><em><strong>Proof:</strong></em>
Since the processes have sample paths a.s. right-continous we have</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{P}[\lim_{s \to t^{+}} X_s = X_t; \forall t \geq 0] = 1$$</p>
<p>and similarly for $Y$, and since $Y$ is a modification of $X$ we get</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{P}[\lim_{s \to t^{+}} X_s = X_t = Y_t = \lim_{s \to t^{+}} Y_s; \forall t \geq 0] = 1,$$</p>
<p>hence proved.</p>
<p>Very simple, isn&rsquo;t it? Well that&rsquo;s how this thing goes, like many things in mathematics it&rsquo;s just a matter of understanding your tools.</p>
