			<div>
				<p>I have prepared a talk which I intend to be my &ldquo;sure, I can give a talk&rdquo; if anyone asks me at any point.</p>
<p>The name is &ldquo;Markov processes and their friends&rdquo; and you can find the first version of it at the end of the
<a href="/academic">Academic</a>
profile.</p>
<p>Or here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/academic/2024-05-20-Pure.pdf">Notes</a></li>
<li><a href="/academic/2024-05-20-Blackboard.pdf">The backboard prep notes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Those notes are the version one of the talk, presented in the Pure PGR Seminar in Leeds.</p>
<p>Oh, also I wrote those notes in <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a> instead of LaTeX, I am liking that thing.
I guess you can make an account there, but I only downloaded the compiler and with that you are good to go, pretty nice considering the alternative is to download the 800 million packages of TeXLive.
There are a number of plugins for Neovim which are nice enough considering how early stage this software is, so I am overall pretty happy. I wish I discovered earlier so to write my thesis on it instead.</p>
