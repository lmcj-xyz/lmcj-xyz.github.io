<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Consider an array <code>A</code> of length <code>m</code> with only non-negative integer entries, then take the sum of the entries of <code>A</code> and denote it by <code>s</code>.
And find the smallest number <code>p</code> that is a multiple of <code>m</code> and is greater or equal than <code>s</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a teeny tiny part of a timed coding question that I blew because I decided to, as any good mathematician would do, overthink it.
So I decided to document it since anyway the damage is done.</p>
<p>My first <em>grug</em> thought was to use a while loop that which stops when we find a multiple of <code>m</code> that is greater or equal than <code>s</code>.
But then I realized that, I am sure the following holds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proposition:</strong> Let $m, n \in \mathbb N$ such that $m \geq n \geq 0$ then there exists $k \in \mathbb N$ such that
$$kn \leq m \leq (k+1)n.$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning that for any pair of numbers we can sandwich one in between consecutive multiples of the other.</p>
<p>That proposition is true, and after my time ran out to solve to overall problem, I decided to prove it.
But in a reckless move I decided to use that result in my code without having mathematical evidence that it was going to work.</p>
<p>The way I used it was to take the sum <code>s = sum(A)</code> and the length <code>m = length(A)</code> of the array <code>A</code>
&mdash;which I will denote as the functions <code>sum</code> and <code>lenght</code> for pseudo code&rsquo;s sake&mdash;
and take its integer division quotient, this is <code>floor(sum(A) / length(A)</code>.
So, in this way the smallest multiple of <code>m</code> that is greater than or equal to <code>s</code> is either  <code>floor(sum(A) / length(A)) * sum(A)</code> or  <code>(floor(sum(A) / length(A) + 1) * sum(A)</code> depending on whether or not <code>s</code> is a multiple of <code>m</code>.
The pseudo code would look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>if floor(sum(A) / length(A)) * sum(A) &lt; sum(A)
    then return (floor(sum(A) / length(A)) + 1) * sum(A)
else return floor(sum(A) / length(A)) * sum(A)
</code></pre><p>You could of course recover instead the factor that makes the multiple you are after, which is actually more akin to what I needed.
But the pseudo code and the approach is basically the same.</p>
<p>So yeh, there you go.
The point is that we cannot use a mathematical result without a proof, so here is my proof to the proposition above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Proof:</em> If $m$ is a multiple of $n$ then obviously we can find some $k$ such that $m = kn$ or $m = (k+1)n$ and the equalities hold.
If $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, we know that in particular for any $a, b \in \mathbb N$ where $b \neq 0$ there are $r, q \in \mathbb N$ such that $a = bq + r$ for $r &lt; b$.
This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division">division with remainder theorem</a>&mdash;also called Euclidean division.
So, let $a = m$ and $b = n$ and we have that $m = qn + r$ for $r &lt; n$.
It&rsquo;s obvious then that $m &gt; qn$ since $r &gt; 0$.
Moreover, since $r &lt; n$ we have that $m &lt; qn + n = (q + 1)n$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may find an either more elegant or more jarring proof, but it&rsquo;s true and now I can rest.</p>
