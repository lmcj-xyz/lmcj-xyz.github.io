				<p>Today I wanted to homogenize the naming on my <strong>totally legally downloaded</strong> (üòâ) collection of maths books, just to (unsurprisingly) see just how messed up the metadata of files you get online is.</p>
<p>And well, I will fix that for my files but it takes some time, and I will gift you the method I came up with to do so, once I finish. But for now, and since I was of course also guilty of not adding metadata to my documents before today, this is just a reminder of how to add metadata to documents typesetted with LaTeX.</p>
<p>Make sure you are using the package <code>hyperref</code> (which you should because your documents also have bookmarks and links between sections and things. Don&rsquo;t they? üòë) and in your preamble just add this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>\hypersetup{pdftitle={Title of your file}, 
		pdfsubject={The subject of your file}, 
	        pdfauthor={The authors of your file},
		pdfkeywords={The keywords of your file}
	       }
</code></pre><p>And that is it!</p>
<p>Just as reference, if I add the following to my file</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>\hypersetup{pdftitle={Convergence rate of $X^N - X$ for McKean equations}, 
		pdfsubject={Probability}, 
	        pdfauthor={Luis Mario Chaparro J√°quez},
		pdfkeywords={SDEs, Besov Space, Feynman-Kac}
	       }
</code></pre><p>and then I trow an <code>exiftool</code> at <code>main.pdf</code> will have the following metadata:</p>
<p><img src="metadata.png" alt="exiftool"></p>
<p>There are many other ways to add useful and non intrusive metadata to files, but I guess if you use LaTeX this is the easiest way.</p>
