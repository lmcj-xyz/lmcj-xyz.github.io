		Neovim 0.11 has dropped, and with it, some new very nice features.
In particular vim.lsp.config and vim.lsp.enable to harness the built-in LSP functionality of Neovim.
Some people seem confused as to how can one use the curated configurations provided by nvim-lspconfig together with these new interfaces. Here I will show you how I did it. It is extremely easy, and it will take you just a few minutes.
Disclaimer: Read the whole thing before copying and pasting anything, it will take you five minutes.

		I use vimtex to aid my way of writing LaTeX in Neovim, but vimtex is written in vimscript and my Neovim configuration is in Lua. As a result, when I am not careful I may spend more time than acceptable to configure something.
Here is how to use vim.fn to access functions from plugins written in vimscript if you use lazy.nvim as your plugin manager.
This is the recommended configuration from vimtex&rsquo;s repo using lazy.

		Here is a post in the form of a LaTeX code snippet.
On the dangers of using plain TeX 1% Let us define a header 2%% Starting with some fonts 3\font\xmplbx = cmbx10 scaled \magstephalf 4%% Here you define the font named \xmplbx by calling the actual font 5%% named cmbx10 and you say that is going to be scaled...how much 6%% is the scale, you may ask? 7%% \magstep is for magnification, and you magnify by 1.

		Problem: Consider an array A of length m with only non-negative integer entries, then take the sum of the entries of A and denote it by s. And find the smallest number p that is a multiple of m and is greater or equal than s.
This was a teeny tiny part of a timed coding question that I blew because I decided to, as any good mathematician would do, overthink it.

		I have prepared a talk which I intend to be my &ldquo;sure, I can give a talk&rdquo; if anyone asks me at any point.
The name is &ldquo;Markov processes and their friends&rdquo; and you can find the first version of it at the end of the Academic profile.
Or here:

The following &ldquo;one-liner&rdquo; will change any wiki style link with a date string formatted as &ldquo;Feb 22nd, 2024&rdquo; to &ldquo;2024-02-22&rdquo;, god&rsquo;s intended way to write a date.
Please forgive the search and replace gore of the second sed.

		Currently I am in a character development arc, in particular dealing with moving because the building management in my building is awful and has just left a leak to make my flat unfit for habitation, and because of that I have learned that one has to be very wary about the company or person which manages the building where you live. And in this search it seems like people who provide reviews for these kind of things have a very strong opinion either positive or negative.

		Important disclaimer: For your own benefit you should never run random commands you find on the internet, this is why whenever I tell you to run a command, immediately after I will let you know exactly what it does. Feel free to check the documentation of the command to be sure I am not lying to you.
This is a follow up of the quick entry I made previously on how to put metadata on your LaTeX generated documents.

		Today I wanted to homogenize the naming on my totally legally downloaded (😉) collection of maths books, just to (unsurprisingly) see just how messed up the metadata of files you get online is.
And well, I will fix that for my files but it takes some time, and I will gift you the method I came up with to do so, once I finish. But for now, and since I was of course also guilty of not adding metadata to my documents before today, this is just a reminder of how to add metadata to documents typesetted with LaTeX.

		If you work or study on mathematics related fields and have a website, you might often want to share your knowledge with the world. Of course, doing it is rather easy with many website creation tools, and there are also many tutorials to do it with any tool you can think of.
So, I want to tell you how to do it using the static site generator Hugo and the JavaScript library KaTeX.
