				<p>So, I am not an statistician.
And as such, I fear statistics.
In particular the I fear the topics I was taught to just follow without any satisfying explanation.
Among those monsters of the dogma of university level statistics, there is a selected group that used to terrify me in such a way that is hard to explain.
That if you asked me before what in the world were the <em>statistical tables</em>, I would have made the sign of the cross, ran away and never talk to you again.</p>
<p>However, recently I was deeply humiliated by somebody posing a question asking me to compute who knows what in order to do a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test">Pearson&rsquo;s chi-squared test</a>.
Naturally, at the moment I fled away, because I had absolutely no idea who Pearson was, and how they got their hands on one of my favourite letters of the Greek alphabet and converted in a synonym of madness.</p>
<p>After showing my deep ignorance about basic statistics I decided to go and revisit my course of statistical methods that I took about seven years ago &mdash;when I was a bright eyed youngster with dreams of grandeur&mdash;, and turns out it&rsquo;s not too bad.
But when I was studying this, my greatest foe showed up.
The dreaded Table A4 from <em>A Basic Course in Statistics</em>, 5th edition by Clarke and Cooke.
And the ever present question during my second year on my engineering degree popped to my mind again</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What in the world are the entries of that table?</p>
</blockquote>
