			<h1>A Sed One Liner to Fix Date Format in Text Files</h1>

				<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>This is a <em>know your tools entry</em>, although I absolutely don&rsquo;t know my tools as you will see if you read.</p>
<p>The following &ldquo;one-liner&rdquo; will change any wiki style link with a date string formatted as &ldquo;Feb 22nd, 2024&rdquo; to &ldquo;2024-02-22&rdquo;, god&rsquo;s intended way to write a date.</p>
<p>Please forgive the search and replace gore of the second <code>sed</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">sed -E <span class="s1">&#39;s;([a-zA-Z]{3})\s([0-9]{1,})(st|nd|rd|th),\s([0-9]{4});\4-\1-\2;&#39;</span> <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="the-lore">The lore</h2>
<p>I had a problem: <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> is my note taking software of choice, it&rsquo;s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliner">outliner</a> which stores files in Markdown format so they are <em>time-proof</em>. Anyway, I wanted my Logseq wiki to be interoperable with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> because the latter respects the Markdown a bit more than the former.</p>
<p>In Logseq you can create Journals/Daily notes, which are ways to track your daily tasks, meetings, or regular notes; or at least that is what I do.
A Journal is just another Markdown file and you can edit it as any other page, and one of the most convenient things of Logseq are its commands.
There is a very convenient command called &ldquo;Date picker&rdquo;, the way to use commands in Logseq is to type &ldquo;/&rdquo;, then a menu pops up and you can search for the command you need, so if you continue typing &ldquo;dat&hellip;&rdquo; it will autocomplete to &ldquo;Date picker&rdquo;, very handy.
However by default Logseq does two things I deeply hate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Journals/Daily notes&rsquo; filenames are in format &ldquo;YYYY_MM_DD.md&rdquo;, (yes with underscores), which conflicts with the standard way Obsidian does it.</li>
<li>The date picker inserts a wiki style link with the format <code>[[MMM DDoo, YYYY]]</code>. If that is not clear,
<ul>
<li><code>MMM</code> means localized month with three letters, e.g. &ldquo;Aug&rdquo; for August in english, &ldquo;ago&rdquo; for August in Spanish.</li>
<li><code>DDoo</code> is the ordinal day of the month, e.g. 14th</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is standard notation for date formats but that&rsquo;s beyond the point.
So for instance for the 2 February 2024, the date picker will insert the link <code>[[Feb 2nd, 2024]]</code></p>
<p>The first point is easy to fix, just modify either the settings in Obsidian or Logseq for both of them to agree in the way they use Journals/Daily notes.
The second point however, is more difficult, especially if you have been using Logseq for a few years and never bothered about how to configure it until recently (like me).
Why is this a problem? You may ask.
Well, Logseq has absolutely no problem following those links because internally it handles the date conversions or something like that, however when Obsidian sees a wikilink like
<code>[[The name of the file]]</code>
it searches the working directory for a file called
<code>The name of the file.md</code>,
so, if your link is
<code>[[Feb 24th, 2024]]</code>
Obsidian will look for
<code>Feb 24th, 2024.md</code>
not for the actual name of the file
<code>2024_02_24.md</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh by the way, to solve the problem of the file names not being the same in Obsidian and Logseq,</p>
<p>In Obsidian you go to
<code>Settings-&gt;Options-&gt;Core plugins-&gt;Daily Notes</code> and then you change the date format to <code>YYYY_MM_DD</code>.
If you want to play by default Logseq rules, or if you want to use a more conventional name then set it to <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.</p>
<p>In Logseq go to
<code>Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Custom configuration</code>
and then you will edit the configuration file
<code>config.edn</code>
(you can just search for it and edit it on your preferred text editor of course),
look for the line which says
<code>:journal/file-name-format</code>
uncomment it and set the vale to the date format you want, in my case I actually wanted &ldquo;yyyy-MM-dd&rdquo;, so the line reads</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">:journal/file-name-format &#34;yyyy-MM-dd&#34;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>additionally you can also set the page title format to</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">:journal/page-title-format &#34;yyyy-MM-dd&#34;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>so Logseq displays the actual title of the note.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-to-do-what-to-do">What to do, what to do&hellip;</h2>
<p>The obvious solution is to create a small script which changes the date format to what I want, in fact I thought of migrating the whole thing into an Obsidian format and I found <a href="https://github.com/NishantTharani/LogSeqToObsidian/tree/main">this Python script</a>, but then I realized I don&rsquo;t really want to do this, I like Logseq, I just need to tweak it a bit.
But then I did go and read the script and thought I could just steal the function called <code>update_files_and_tags</code> in the file <a href="https://github.com/NishantTharani/LogSeqToObsidian/blob/main/convert_notes.py">convert_notes.py</a>.</p>
<p>This seemed overkill, I literally need to edit some files, I am sure I can do it with the standard <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">Coreutils</a>, so I embarked on the thrilling adventure of learning a bit about <code>sed</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>grep</code>.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-what-i-did">This is what I did</h2>
<p>My attempts were relentless&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="tried-using-date">Tried using <code>date</code></h3>
<p>I thought we can use <code>date</code> by either looping over the lines of a file like so</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">while read -r line; do 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">    echo $(date -d &#34;$line&#34; +%Y-%m-%d); 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">done &lt; filename.md
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>because I went and read the answers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43697746/how-to-change-date-format-in-linux-unix-text-file">this StackOverflow question</a> and I thought, &ldquo;oh that looks quite smart&rdquo; NOOOOOOT. One can simply go an read the manual (literally the first displayed screen) by typing <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html"><code>man date</code></a> and realize that the <code>-f</code> flag will save you from doing a silly loop, so you can also do</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">date -f filename.md +%Y-%m-%d
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Those are more or less equivalent, the <code>-d</code> flag reads a string which in the loop will be each line of the file, while the <code>-f</code> flag reads the entire file and tries applying the date format to each line.</p>
<p>The problem of those approaches is that they expect you to have exactly the date you want to change in each line, no more no less&hellip;or I guess so, I haven&rsquo;t tried extensively, nevertheless this is not what I wanted.
Remember I am applying this to my notes, in the files the dates are within the text.
Besides, if a particular line had a date that I want to change this is always going to be enclosed by <code>[[</code> and <code>]]</code>, and this makes it not understandable for the command <code>date</code>.
And one more thing, <code>date</code> doesn&rsquo;t do ordinal numbers, &ldquo;Feb 2nd, 2024&rdquo; is not recognizable as a date for the utility <code>date</code>.</p>
<h3 id="then-using-sed-and-date">Then using <code>sed</code> and <code>date</code></h3>
<p>Then I found somebody (also in StackOverflow but I cannot find the link any more) suggesting to use <code>sed</code> to convert your strings into <code>date</code> recognizable dates and then piping into <code>date</code>.
At this point I wasn&rsquo;t sure how <code>date</code> actually works, it took me a few attempts to learn that <code>date</code> is expecting no more than an actual date as the first string in a line as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>This, however gave me an idea&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="just-use-sed-man">Just use <code>sed</code>, man</h3>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just use <code>sed</code> to find dates through a regular expression and change it for what we want, at this moment I thought &ldquo;I will make a very ingenious one-liner to brag about on the internet&rdquo;, just to realize that piping will just work.
Embrace the <a href="https://grugbrain.dev/">gruging</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, what is piping?
Normally a command has an output, for instance</p>
<p><code>echo &quot;Hello&quot;</code></p>
<p>will print the string &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; on your console, if you want to use the output of a command as the argument for other command you can use the pipe operator <code>|</code> to redirect the output to another utility, e.g.</p>
<p><code>echo &quot;Hello&quot; | grep &quot;H&quot;</code></p>
<p>which although this is a silly example it will take the word string &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and feed it to <code>grep</code>, which will highlight the match of the letter &ldquo;H&rdquo; in the word &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;.
If you want, go and read more <a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/pipes-command-line-linux">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, I went and read this <a href="https://csiro-data-school.github.io/regex/index.html">intro to regular expressions</a>, because obviously I don&rsquo;t remember such things and I need to go and learn every time I need to use them. Really nice tutorial though. And along the way I was implementing my solution.</p>
<p>So I went by steps, let us first find our wikilinks with dates, we can use <code>grep</code> just so we can see what we find, and then afterwards use <code>sed</code> to substitute.
Both have the same syntax for regex.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">grep -E &#39;\[\[([a-zA-Z]{3})\s([0-9]{1,})(st|nd|rd|th),\s([0-9]{4})\]\]&#39;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The line above will find the wikilinks of this format <code>[[MMM DDoo, YYY]]</code> and show them to you, once you are sure it works you can make your substitution by placing that into a search and replace thing in sed, this would be</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">sed -E &#39;s;([a-zA-Z]{3})\s([0-9]{1,})(st|nd|rd|th),\s([0-9]{4});\4-\1-\2;&#39; &#34;$1&#34;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are a few things to notice there, first I realized I don&rsquo;t actually need to match <code>[[</code> and <code>]]</code> because all the instances where I have dates have been inserted with the date picker and it always creates wikilinks anyway, so it&rsquo;s redundant.
Second, see that I have some things enclosed in circle brackets, like <code>([a-zA-Z]{3})</code>, this is so I can make back-references, so when we encircle our matches we can refer to them within <code>sed</code> by typing <code>\#</code>, this is backlash and the number of the match.
This is why in the replacement string we have <code>\4-\1-\2</code>, we want to substitute our match with the matches 4, 1 and 2 separated by dashes.
Notice that we skipped <code>\3</code> this is because <code>\3</code> matches the ordinal suffix which we don&rsquo;t want.
I presume if I didn&rsquo;t enclose the suffix in circle brackets it wouldn&rsquo;t have matter but then I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to match those strings, although I could have just matched them using <code>[a-z]{2}</code>, this is matching any two consecutive lower-case letters.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s explain that regex above before going to the next ones which are much simpler.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">([a-zA-Z]{3})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>[a-zA-Z]</code> matches any letter from the English language, and since this is localized that is enough, then <code>{3}</code> is a quantifier which says &ldquo;whatever is before me, make it three&rdquo;. You can put any positive integer <em>n</em> instead of 3 (I guess it could be non-negative but why would you match zero letters?).
I encircle the three letters so I can refer back to it, this will have the reference <code>\1</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">\s([0-9]{1,})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>matches a space with <code>\s</code>, then <code>[0-9]</code> matches any digit and the quantifier <code>{1,}</code> says &ldquo;whatever is before me, give me at least one&rdquo;, this is because the day will have either one or two digits. I could have used <code>{1,2}</code> which limits you to find 1 or 2 or whatever is before, but I just thought about that while writing this entry so I didn&rsquo;t.
I encircle the one or two digits so I can refer back to it, this will have the reference <code>\2</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">(st|nd|rd|th)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Is an <em>or</em> statement, so I am asking for either one of the strings &ldquo;st&rdquo;, &ldquo;nd&rdquo;, &ldquo;rd&rdquo; or &ldquo;th&rdquo;, the ordinal suffixes in English.
I encircle the suffix so I can refer back to it, this will have the reference <code>\3</code>, although I will not use it but I think for the <em>or</em> statement I cannot not encircle it anyway.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">,\s([0-9]{4})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, I want to match a literal comma, a space and four digits.
I encircle the four digits so I can refer back to it, this will have the reference <code>\3</code></p>
<p>Then this matches will be substituted by</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">\4-\1-\2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which is the references of the matches before, so if I had the link
<code>[[Feb 24th, 2024]]</code>
it will be substituted to
<code>[[2024-Feb-24]]</code>.
This is close but it&rsquo;s not quite what I want, because it has first of all the month still as <code>MMM</code> and if the day was a single digit <code>n</code> the last part of the new date will be a single digit <code>n</code> instead of the desired output <code>0n</code>.
So, it&rsquo;s time for PIPING.</p>
<p>Oh and at the end I have <code>$1</code>, this is just the file argument of a script call, because I wrote this as a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">shell/bash</a> script and I call it by typing <code>./ldate filename.md</code>, so this will call the <code>sed</code> command on the file <code>filename.md</code></p>
<h3 id="the-piping">The piping</h3>
<p>Originally I wanted to call everything together but I realise I actually need the output from the sed above and then I want to substitute the month and the day if it has a single digit.</p>
<p>So I did a big pattern matching sequence for each month of the year which you can see here</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">sed -E &#39;s/-Jan-/-01-/;s/-Feb-/-02-/;s/-Mar-/-03-/;s/-Apr-/-04-/;s/-May-/-05-/;s/-Jun-/-05-/;s/-Jul-/-07-/;s/-Aug-/-08-/;s/-Sep-/-09-/;s/-Oct-/-10-/;s/-Nov-/-11-/;s/-Dec-/-12-/&#39;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yes, it&rsquo;s ugly, but it works. I wanted to do something smarter like the dictionary used by the Logseq to Obsidian migration script I mentioned above, I wanted to solve this quickly so I can write a blog entry about it, five minutes of web browsing didn&rsquo;t give me the answer so here we are.</p>
<p>This just does what it says, first looks for the string &ldquo;-Jan-&rdquo; and changes it by &ldquo;-01-&rdquo;, then for the string &ldquo;Feb&rdquo; and replaces it by &ldquo;-02-&rdquo;, you get the idea.
The dashes were necessary because I may have those strings in other places and I don&rsquo;t want them changed, for one there is a person I know called <em>Jan</em> and sometimes I refer to this person in my notes because I may need to remember I have a meeting with him or something, so I don&rsquo;t want his name changed by &ldquo;01&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Note, that here my search and replace is bookended by forward slashes <code>/</code> instead of semi-colons <code>;</code> as I did before.
This is for convenience, and readability, you can use any character that you are not going to match.</p>
<p>The final step is the following</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">	sed -E &#39;s;-([0-9])\];-0\1];&#39; &gt; &#34;$1&#34;.done
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here the match is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">-([0-9])\]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>which is one dash <code>-</code>, exactly one digit <code>[0-9]</code>, and one closing square bracket <code>\]</code>, I enclose the digit and refer to it in the substitution as <code>\1</code>.
This pattern is easy but it can be dangerous, the trick here is to think that I only care about digits which are between a dash and a closing square bracket.
If I don&rsquo;t account for that, I will be matching digits everywhere and that could be problematic.</p>
<p>Then, at the end I forward the output of the piping into a file which is going to be called <code>filename.md.done</code> if I called the script on a file called <code>filename.md</code>.
Just to have some backup, doing that you just move all files called <code>*.md</code> to where you want them and remove the <code>.done</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s how you do it, or at least one way to do it.
I am sure there are more elegant ways.</p>
<p>The way I applied it was by calling a loop over the files of the directory when I wanted to apply it, i.e.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl">for filename in *;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">2</span><span class="cl">    do ./ldate &#34;${filename}&#34;;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="ln">3</span><span class="cl">done
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This calls my script <code>./ldate</code> over each file in the current working directory.
You could potentially add the script to a directory on your <code>PATH</code> and not have to move your script around, but I didn&rsquo;t do it because most likely I won&rsquo;t need the script ever again, so I just spent a few hours writing a &ldquo;one-liner&rdquo; sed to change the date format in files and documenting it on this entry.</p>
<p>It was quite fun.</p>
